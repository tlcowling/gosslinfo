# GOSSLINFO

## Usage:

Gives you some very basic information about a TLS connection, such as the tls version and the ciphersuite

```bash
gosslinfo https://www.google.com
```

## Reason:

Because I'm well into golang innit, and I also wanted a mega simple tool to display tls basics
Finally I wanted to do super fast development so its small enough that I completed it in one sitting.
